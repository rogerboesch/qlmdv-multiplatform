#### Multiplatform-Frontend for the qlt tools

*(Screenshot coming soon)*

This is a quick and dirty hack (I made in a few hours) to simplify the usage of the qlt tools.
It allows to manage microdrive image files for the Sinclair QL in an easy way.
The qlt tools themselves are copyright by [Jan Venema](http://web.inter.nl.net/hcc/A.Jaw.Venema/) and created in 1990.
In the current stage I have just slightly changed the qlt c-functions itself, but will refactor them to C++ later.

### How to create a nice looking user interface for macOS with minimal effort. 

Also I uploaded here a portion of some Swift/Objective-C base classes which allows to create a macOS App in a few hours
and give them a nice looking user interface.
Feel free to use them for your own projects.

I work also on a UWP version of this classes to allow in future to create Windows apps in the same simple way.
*(I don't like so much to use cross platform libraries like QT for such. Too much overhead for simple projects)*
